Hi , I've designed and built a responsive front-end website for Sugar Bliss Bakery, focusing on clean UI/UX and delicious visuals.

✅ Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structured the layout with semantic tags, sectioned content clearly.
- CSS: Styled it with pastel colors, soft shadows, hover animations, and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Added interactivity — including a contact form with validation.

🎀 Key Features:
- Fully responsive cake card grid — aligned neatly for desktop and mobile.
- Custom background image with a soft overlay for visual clarity.
- Google Fonts & hover effects for stylish typography.
- Animated text that glows or bounces on hover.
- Order form with validation for user details.

I fixed layout issues by aligning containers with Flexbox, ensuring the cake cards stacked neatly. Every cake image was carefully chosen to match the theme — and the entire vibe reflects warmth, sweetness, and elegance. 🍓

If you want, I can help you wrap this into a proper portfolio write-up, or deploy it live with a shareable mobile link. You've frosted this front-end beautifully, chef! 💫
